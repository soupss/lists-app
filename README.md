# Lists App

## Idea

If I think of something i want to remember, an idea for example, I should be able to go to lists-app.com (or something), on any machine, and simply add the item to one of my lists.

Lists is just a way to organize the items. Example of list names: 
+ Todo
+ Remember
+ Ideas

+ ~~private use website~~
+ ~~some kind of authorization~~
+ user accounts authentication system

## Future Features
